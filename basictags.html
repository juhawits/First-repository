How did you find energy, <b> Mom </b> <br />
To do all things you did, <br />
To be a teacher, nure and councelor <br />
To me, when I was a kid <br /> <br />
How did you do it all, <b> Mom </b> <br />
Be a chauffeur, cook and friend,<br />
Yet find time to be a playmate, <br />
I just can't comprehend, <br /> <br />
I see now it was alone, <b> Mom </b> <br />
That made you come whenver I'd call, <br />
Your inexhaustible love, <b> Mom </b> <br />
And I <b> thank you for it all </b> <br /> <br /> <br />
